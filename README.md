# Conway's Game of Life

A Graphical Interface Application which accepts the starting conditions and helps the user to observe the Game of Life through many generations.

## Rules of the game

-   Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
-   Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
-   All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
